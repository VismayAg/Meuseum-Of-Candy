                            Candy, also called sweets or lollies is a confection
                            that features sugar as a principal ingredient. The category, called sugar confectionery, encompasses any sweet
                            confection, including chocolate, chewing gum, and sugar candy. Vegetables, fruit, or nuts which have been glazed and
                            coated with sugar are said to be candied.".</p>

                        <p class="lead">Sugar candies include hard candies, soft candies, caramels, marshmallows, taffy, and other candies whose principal
                        ingredient is sugar. Commercially, sugar candies are often divided into groups according to the amount of sugar they
                        contain and their chemical structure.
                        
                        Hard-boiled candies made by the vacuum cooking process include stick candy, lemon drops and horehound drops. Open-fire
                        candy, like molasses taffy and cream taffy, is cooked in open kettles and then pulled. Pan work candies include nuts and
                        other candies like jelly beans and sugar-coated almonds, made by coating with sugar in revolving copper kettles. Gum
                        work candy is cooked in large kettles fashioned for melting and molded, dried and sugared like gum drops. They are
                        soaked for a time in sugar syrup to allow crystals to form.</p>

                        <img src="imgs/lolli_icon.png" alt="" class="d-none d-lg-inline">
                        <p class="lead">Prior to the 1900s, candy was commonly sold unwrapped from carts in the street, where it was exposed to dirt and
                        insects. By 1914, there were some machines to wrap gum and stick candies, but this was not the common practice. After
                        the polio outbreak in 1916, unwrapped candies garnered widespread censure because of the dirt and germs. At the time,
                        only upscale candy stores used glass jars. With advancements in technology, wax paper was adopted, and foil and
                        cellophane were imported to the U.S. from France by DuPont in 1925. Necco packagers were one of the first companies to
                        package without human touch. Kiosks and vending machines were introduced around the beginning of the 20th
                        century.
                        
                        Candy packaging played a role in its adoption as the most popular treat given away during trick-or-treating for
                        Halloween in the US. In the 1940s, most treats were homemade. During the 1950s, small, individually wrapped candies were
                        recognized as convenient and inexpensive. By the 1970s, after widely publicized but largely false stories of poisoned
                        candy myths circulating in the popular press, factory-sealed packaging with a recognizable name brand on it became a
                        sign of safety.</p>
